**Beloved & Beyond is a SocialFi and Commerce platform** that bridges web2 and web3, designed to convert users swiftly, at scale, and with minimal cost.

Currently, only 2-3% of global internet users are engaged in web3, leaving over 97% unaware or unengaged. This untapped potential drives Beloved & Beyond’s mission: to **transition 100 million users from web2 to web3** in the near term.

To achieve this, **Beloved & Beyond has built an advanced technology platform with features that attract, retain, and convert users through daily check-ins and bill-scanning for rewards**. From everyday purchases—coffee, groceries, dining, travel, utility payments, to online shopping—users earn unlimited BB points, making web3 rewards seamlessly integrated into daily habits.

With this approach, Beloved & Beyond has the **potential to reach 60-70% of users in Vietnam and across Southeast Asia**, as daily spending is universal. Our platform mirrors web3 principles, giving each location and business its own reward points, with BB as a common currency for conversions. This flexible point-exchange system introduces users to web3 transactions, gently adapting them to web3 practices.

**As users become familiar, they can transition from BB points to RLUSD, storing and spending this currency directly on Beloved & Beyond.**

This strategy allows us to bridge the web2 to web3 transition smoothly, by tapping into everyday needs. **The Beloved & Beyond platform is now fully built and entering the scale-up phase, poised for accelerated growth**. With investment, we can drive rapid and early market impact.

Our ecosystem is ready, with a robust pipeline that engages users, accumulates points, and enables seamless spending (for rewards, gifts, and e-commerce transactions).

**We seek timely funding to expedite this transformation, bringing web3—particularly RLUSD—into practical, real-world spending.**
